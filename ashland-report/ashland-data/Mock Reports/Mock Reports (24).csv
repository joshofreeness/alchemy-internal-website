They commented that the big opportunity is to develop a synthetic alternative to Attapulgite clay. Current rheology companies are only offering pseudoplasticity and Resene need thixotropy. Attapulgite gives them the required true thixotropy, but imparts yellowing and has a high binder demand, so a synthetic alternative would be fantastic.

Bostik NZ have ~15 CTA formulations, but there are 2-3 that are key formulations.

On observing all the formulation, we can conclude that both the competition MC and RDP and with C 8381 and N 2028 behave same in the wet mortar properties. But the final strengths are a little improved in all the cases. Hence, with the same replacements and keeping other conditions constant, C8381 and N2028 perform better in all the formulations. Most of the requirements of the customer is fulfilled, to move from competition to our portfolio.
However evaluation by Bostik showed with C 8381, the water demand on the C1 adhesive is appx 10-12 % more than the Tylose mix. In the C2S1 adhesive, it is even higher.
Comments by ASI European experts confirmed that C 8381 is in no way a suitable replacement.

Decora Group Ltd,Aquaflow for Trim & Broadwall (Premium & Trade),Sampled,30/08/2015,8000,10,"Currently use a number of rheology modifiers and appreciate that some are old technology and so keen to rationalise, but have limited technical resources.
Would like ASI to evaluate the rheology of Decora paint in comparison to a market leader's paint in the following areas and recommend a rheology system:
1. Trim Paint - use RM5000
2. Premium Broadwall - use Plus 330, RM 2020, Rheolate 244 & RM8
3. Trade Broadwall - use ~2 x Plus 330, RM5, Rheolate 244

They want some more universal RM's and for high shear less problem with colour. Made the following comments on competitor RM's.
Rheolate 244 - Mid-shear. Solved some issues they had with RM 2020 & RM 8 combo, but is worst for viscosity drift (time to associate)
Acrysol TT-615 - Use in some high build formulations - would like an alternative
Acrysol RM 5000 - Happy with efficiency in self cross linking trim formulations
Acrysol RM-5 - Believe there must be more efficient alternatives
Acrysol RM 2020 - still in a number of formulations
Acrysol RM8 - Thick and difficult to use, but does efficiently build KU.
