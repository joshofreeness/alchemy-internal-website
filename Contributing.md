Contributing
============
You probably don't want to contribute to this project unless Alchemy is paying you, which is fine.

I'm trying my best to use a variant of the git flow branching model by
doing the following:
- Big changes are developed under feature/* branches and only merged when
  they are complete, also master is merged into them regularly
- Bugs are fixed under fix/* branches and merged into main when completed
- Branches that are not being actively developed on should be removed

I usually try to refactor parts of the project to make them cleaner when I
need to do some significant changes around them. There is lots of hackery
in this project because it was developed to fit a specific purpose for
Alchemy and I think that it's better to quickly implement features that
can be tried by the staff and if the feature is well liked it can be
improved from there. There is no point in making features highly
configurable and robust if they aren't needed by the staff or if they want
them changed.

I'll probably be too busy to keep maintaining this project for Alchemy in
a few years, so if you are taking over the project and need help getting
the development environment setup on your machine, or help userstanding
components of the project you can contact me.
