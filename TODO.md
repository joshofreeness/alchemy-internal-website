TODO:
- Nick: Verify/Figure out sales metrics. In the customers/show view I am
  using the table "Sales Archive Line" to get those numbers, they may not
be the correct values, someone from alchemy may need to use NAV to
calculate some values to make comparisons.
- Stop paying current website provider (Four Acres Limited)
- Reorder all charts to: Volume, Sales, Cost, Margin
- All charts that can, use Alchemy colour scheme
- Sales -> Individual, use gross margin
- Implement the concept of NZ and AUS records, and the ability to flip between then and combine them
- All charts show only 5 years
- Customer: add chart (Volume, Sales, Margin)
- All appropriate charts, add note "Alchemy Calendar/Financial year"
- Add PIF as standard document type, use the Item type column to see if it is needed
- Implemented sending documents via email
- Add button for updating all the tables, admin only
- Product - Show page: have a next button/buttons based on product manager
- API:
	* Vendor images (link vendor image and vendor id)
	* Customer User and relates to products
- Implement Customer User managerment
