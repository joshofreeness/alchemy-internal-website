TODO:
- Verify/Figure out sales metrics. In the customers/show view I am using
  the table "Sales Archive Line" to get those numbers, they may not be the
  correct values, someone from alchemy may need to use NAV to calculate
  some values to make comparisons.

- Vendor sales graphs:
	* For each vendor produce over the last 5 years:
		- Volume
		- Sales dollars
		- Margin
		- Cost

- Implement ability to link Vendor logo to each vendor, perhaps in
  vendor/show

- Allow for arbitrary documents to be linked to product in products/show
