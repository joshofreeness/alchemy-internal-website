TODO:
- Nick: Verify/Figure out sales metrics. In the customers/show view I am
  using the table "Sales Archive Line" to get those numbers, they may not
be the correct values, someone from alchemy may need to use NAV to
calculate some values to make comparisons.
- Stop paying current website provider (Four Acres Limited)
- Reorder all charts to: Volume, Sales, Cost, Margin
- All charts that can, use Alchemy colour scheme
- Sales -> Individual, use gross margin
- Implement the concept of NZ and AUS records, and the ability to flip between then and combine them
- All charts show only 5 years
- Customer: add chart (Volume, Sales, Margin)
- All appropriate charts, add note "Alchemy Calendar/Financial year"
- Add PIF as standard document type, use the Item type column to see if it is needed
- Add button for updating all the tables, admin only
- Product - Show page: have a next button/buttons based on product manager
- MISC files, ability to label misc files with a description from a drop down. You can also add descriptions to the drop down.
- Put expiries on every document, default the expiry date to 5 years since upload. Add ability to create new document types
- Finish off rich text emailing. Added footer for each user and ability to modify it.
- Look in notes.txt and fix up agencies charts.
